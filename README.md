## ABOUT THE PROJECT
The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project is a comprehensive initiative that enables in-depth analysis of conflicts and crisis mapping by providing disaggregated data. This dataset records information on the dates and locations of political violence and protests reported in multiple African countries, particularly those in the developing world. The project covers a broad range of events, including those that take place during civil wars and periods of instability, as well as instances of public protest and regime breakdown. It encompasses all African nations and spans from 1997 to the present day.
